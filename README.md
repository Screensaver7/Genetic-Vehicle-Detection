# Vehicle-and-Lane-Detection
Vehicle and Lane Detection

Research Project Goal

We have a set of stoplight surveillance videos of vehicles. Our goal is to detect the vehicles in those videos and decide if they’re going straight or turning.

Research Project Scope

Given videos of vehicles running by a stoplight, determine which lane each vehicle is in and where is it moving.

Data

                We will collect videos of surveillance cameras from several stoplights.

Tasks

·         Obtain videos of surveillance cameras

·         Detect vehicles in the videos and determine which lane they’re in

·         Pedestrians if there are any
