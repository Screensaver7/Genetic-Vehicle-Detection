#Usage
The methods we wrote were hard coded for the highway dataset.

Prequisites:
1. Python 2.7.x
2. OpenCV 3.0
3. Numpy
4. Scipy
5. Highway databse from somewhere

Running it:
1. Open terminal at .py file
2. Make sure highway folder is in the same directory
3. python genetic_vehicle_detect.py 8 5
number of iterations = 8, number of population = 5

#Research Project Goal

We have a set of stoplight surveillance videos of vehicles. Our goal is to detect the vehicles in those videos and decide if they’re going straight or turning.

#Research Project Scope

Given videos of vehicles running by a stoplight, determine which lane each vehicle is in and where is it moving.

#Data

We will collect videos of surveillance cameras from several stoplights.

#Tasks

1. Obtain videos of surveillance cameras

2. Detect vehicles in the videos and determine which lane they’re in

3. Pedestrians if there are any
